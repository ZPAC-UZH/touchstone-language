# Touchstone Language (TSL)

TSL is a language for describing experimental design.
The parser (dynamically generated from `parser.jison`) parse the TSL specification and generate abstract syntax tree. 
Then, the syntax tree is taken by the generator (`generator.ts`) to create the corresponding trial tables.  

The code is written in TypeScript, together with `worker.js` which is copied (with additions at the header and footer) from the Touchstone 2 codebase.
The source code is stored in `src` and the compiled code is in `dist`.
However, `worker.js` need to be manually copied.

[Touchstone2](https://github.com/ZPAC-UZH/touchstone2) a GUI for designing experiments.


## Instlalation and scripts

- `npm run build` - compiles the TypeScript files to JavaScript
- `npm run test` - runs all unit tests
- `npm run trial-table` - generates a trial table for 4 participants based on a tsl file
- `parser` - returns the parsed object from tsl
- `rpc-server` - starts up the rpc server

## Compiling one TSL file

* Compiling one TSL file

```bash
node dist/src/run_parser.js [tsl_path]
```

If `tsl_path` is not set, the script use the variable `input_path` defined in the file.

This command is also good if the parser (`tsl.jison`) doesn't compile properly because the detailed parsing error will be printed in the console. 

* Generating trial table

```bash
node dist/src/run_generator.js [tsl_path]
```

## Testing

The test cases are in `test` folder.
TSL input are in the `test/testcases` folder.
 
Run the tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run all tests in the folder, watch for file changes, and re-run them.
If you add a new test file, you'll have quit (Ctrl + C) and re-run this command.


## Calling TSL from a remote process

TSL can be called from other process, which may be written in another language such as Python. 

* Install ZeroMQ. 
  * Mac: 
    * install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    * run `brew install zeromq`
* Install zerorpc-node `npm install --no-save zerorpc`
* Run the server `node dist/src/rpc_server.js`

The server will listen to requests at port 4242. (The port number is hard-coded.)


### Example Python 3 client

* Install `msgpack`: `pip install msgpack`
* Install `zerorpc`:  `pip install zerorpc`
* Run the example: `python examples/python_rpc_client/client.py`


## Extension

### Trial table generator

To add a new type of a trial table generator that corresponds to the design node in TSL abstract syntax tree, 
simply create the generator with the function signature in the type `TSLGeneratorFunction` (see: `tsl_types.ts`).

Then, register the function with the corresponding name of the AST node with the following command:

```javascript
TSLStrategyRegistry.sharedRegistry().addGeneratorForStrategy("between", generator);
``` 

See an example in `src/counterbalancing/between.ts`.

## Tips

To debug the jison code, the following command will allow you to print entire hierarchy of variables. 

```javascript
console.log(require('util').inspect(result, true, 10)); 
```

## TODOs

All TODOs are commented in the code in `src` folder.
